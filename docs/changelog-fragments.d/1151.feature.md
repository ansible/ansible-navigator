Added `--effective` and `--sources` to the settings subcommand.

Here's an example:

```bash
# Print out all current and default settings in settings file format.
ansible-navigator settings --effective
# Print out the source of each settings entry
ansible-navigator settings --sources
```

-- by {user}`cidrblock`
