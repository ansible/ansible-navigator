Enabled the use of the `time_zone` settings entry for playbook
artifact file name creation. The new default playbook artifact name is:

```
{playbook_dir}/{playbook_name}-artifact-{time_stamp}.json
```

The time stamp is an ISO8601 formatted timestamp based on the user
specified time zone (IANA or 'local'), or UTC as the default.
