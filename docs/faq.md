## The `ansible.cfg` file

### Where should the `ansible.cfg` file go when using an execution environment?

The easiest place to have the `ansible.cfg` is in the project directory adjacent to the playbook. The playbook directory is automatically mounted in the execution environment and the `ansible.cfg` file will be found. If the `ansible.cfg` file is in another directory, the `ANSIBLE_CONFIG` variable needs to be set and the directory specified as a custom volume mount. (See the [settings guide](settings.rst) for `execution-environment-volume-mounts`)

### Where should the `ansible.cfg` file go when not using an execution environment?

Ansible will look for the `ansible.cfg` in the typical locations when not using an execution-environment. (See the ansible docs for the possibilities)

## Placement of ansible collections

### Where should ansible collections be placed when using an execution environment?

The easiest place to have ansible collections is in the project directory, in a playbook adjacent collections directory. (eg `ansible-galaxy collections install ansible.utils -p ./collections`). The playbook directory is automatically mounted in the execution environment and the collections should be found. Another option is to build the collections into an execution environment using [ansible builder](https://ansible-builder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This was done to help playbook developers author playbooks that are production ready, as both ansible controller and awx support playbook adjacent collection directories. If the collections are in another directory, the `ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATHS` variable needs to be set and the directory specified as a custom volume mount. (See the [settings guide](settings.rst) for `execution-environment-volume-mounts`)

### Where should ansible collections be placed when not using an execution environment?

When not using an execution environment, ansible will look in the default locations for collections. For more information about these, check out the [collections guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html).

## `ansible-navigator` settings

### What is the order in which configuration settings are applied?

The configuration system of ansible-navigator pulls in settings from various sources and applies them hierarchically in the following order (where the last applied changes are the most prevalent):

1. Default internal values
2. Values from a [settings file](settings.rst)
3. Values from environment variables
4. Flags and arguments specified on the command line
5. While issuing `:` commands within the text-based user interface (TUI)

### Why does `ansible-navigator` change the terminal colors or look terrible?

`ansible-navigator` queries the terminal for its OSC4 compatibility. OSC4, 10, 11, 104, 110, 111 indicate the terminal supports color changing and reverting. It is possible that the terminal is misrepresenting its ability. OSC4 detection can be disabled by setting `--osc4 false`. (See the [settings guide](settings.rst) for how to handle this with an environment variable or in the settings file)

### How can I change the colors used by `ansible-navigator`

Full theme support should come in a later release, for now, try `--osc4 false`. This will cause `ansible-navigator` to use the terminal's defined colors. (See the [settings guide](settings.rst) for how to handle this with an environment variable or in the settings file)

### What's with all these `site-artifact-2021-06-02T16:02:33.911259+00:00.json` files in the playbook directory?

`ansible-navigator` creates a playbook artifact for every playbook run. These can be helpful for reviewing the outcome of automation after it is complete, sharing and troubleshooting with a colleague, or keeping for compliance or change-control purposes. The playbook artifact file contains the detailed information about every play and task, as well as the stdout from the playbook run. Playbook artifacts can be review with `ansible-navigator replay <filename>` or `:replay <filename>` while in an ansible-navigator session. All playbook artifacts can be reviewed with both `--mode stdout` and `--mode interactive`, depending on the desired view. Playbook artifacts writing can be disabled and the default file naming convention changed as well.(See the [settings guide](settings.rst) for additional information)

### Why does `vi` open when I use `:open`?

`ansible-navigator` will open anything showing in the terminal in the default editor. The default is set to either `vi +{line_number} {filename}` or the current value of the `EDITOR` environment variable. Related to this is the `editor-console` setting which indicates if the editor is console/terminal based. Here are examples of alternate settings that may be useful:

```yaml
# emacs
ansible-navigator:
  editor:
    command: emacs -nw +{line_number} {filename}
    console: true
```

```yaml
# vscode
ansible-navigator:
  editor:
    command: code -g {filename}:{line_number}
    console: false
```

```yaml
#pycharm
ansible-navigator:
  editor:
    command: charm --line {line_number} {filename}
    console: false
```

### How do I define volume mounts using an environment variable?

Because the definition of a volume mount may contain the `:` these need to be delimited with a `;`.

```bash
$ export ANSIBLE_NAVIGATOR_EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT_VOLUME_MOUNTS /tmp/1:/tmp/1\;/tmp/2:/tmp/2:Z
$ ansible-navigator exec
bash-4.4# ls /tmp/1
file.txt
```

### How can `tls-verify` be disabled when an execution environment image is being pulled?

Although disabling TLS verification is not recommended, it may be necessary in lab and non-production environments. The pull policy parameters can be provided on the command line or in the settings file.

```bash
$ ansible-navigator --pull-arguments=--tls-verify=false
```

```yaml
ansible-navigator:
  execution-environment:
    pull:
      arguments:
        - "--tls-verify=false"
```

## SSH keys

### How do I use my SSH keys with an execution environment?

The simplest way to use SSH keys with an execution environment is to use `ssh-agent` and use default key names. Register keys as needed if they do not use one of the default key names. (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`, `~/.ssh/id_dsa`, `~/.ssh/id_ecdsa`, `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, and `~/.ssh/identity`. (eg `ssh-add ~/.ssh/my_key`). `ansible-navigator` will automatically setup and enable the use of `ssh-agent` within the execution environment by volume mounting the SSH authentication socket path and setting the SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable. (eg

`-v /run/user/1000/keyring/:/run/user/1000/keyring/ -e SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/run/user/1000/keyring/ssh` (as seen in the `ansible-navigator` log file when using an execution environment and `--log-level debug`)

The use of `ssh-agent` results in the simplest configuration and eliminates issues with SSH key passphrases when using `ansible-navigator` with execution environments.

Additionally, `ansible-navigator` will automatically volume mount the user's SSH keys into the execution environment in 2 different locations to assist users not running `ssh-agent`.

1. For compatibility with SSH connections using OpenSSH, the keys are mounted into the home directory of the default user within the execution environment as specified by the user's entry in the execution environment's `/etc/passwd` file. When using OpenSSH without `ssh-agent`, only keys using the default names (`id_rsa`, `id_dsa`, `id_ecdsa`, `id_ed25519`, and `id_xmss`) will be used. The use of `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` will enable the use of non-default named keys.

`-v /home/current_user/.ssh/:/root/.ssh/` (as seen in the `ansible-navigator` log file when using an execution environment and `--log-level debug`)

2. For compatibility with SSH connections using `paramiko`, the keys are mounted into the home directory of the default user within the execution environment as specified by the `HOME` environment variable within the execution environment. When using `paramiko` without `ssh-agent`, only key using default names (`id_rsa`, `id_dsa` or `id_ecdsa`, and `id_ed25519`) will by used. The use of `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` will enable the use of non-default named keys.

`-v /home/current_user/.ssh/:/home/runner/.ssh/` (as seen in the `ansible-navigator` log file when using an execution environment and `--log-level debug`)

Note: When using `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` with execution environments, the path to the key needs to reference it's location after being volume mounted to the execution environment. (eg `/home/runner/.ssh/key_name` or `/root/.ssh/key_name`). It may be convenient to specify the path to the key as `~/.ssh/key_name` which will resolve to the user's home directory with or without the use of an execution environment.

## Compatibility with `ansible-*` utilities

### Why does the playbook hang when `vars_prompt`, `pause/prompt` or `--ask-pass` is used?

By default `ansible-navigator` runs the playbook in the same manner that ansible controller and AWX would run the playbook. This was done to help playbook developers author playbooks that would be ready for production. If the use of `vars_prompt`, `pause\prompt` or `--ask-pass` can not be avoided, disabling `playbook-artifact` creation and using `--mode stdout` causes `ansible-navigator` to run the playbook in a manner that is compatible with `ansible-playbook` and allows for user interaction.

```bash
$ ansible-navigator run site.yml --mode stdout --playbook-artifact-enable false --ask-pass
```

### How can I use `ansible-test` without having it locally installed?

The `ansible-test` utility can be used from within an execution environment using the `exec` subcommand.

```bash
$ cd  ./collections/ansible_collections/ansible/utils/
$ ansible-navigator exec -- ansible-test sanity --python 3.8
```

### How do I use `ansible-playbook` parameters like `--forks 15`?

All parameters not directly used by `ansible-navigator` will be passed to the `ansible-playbook` command. These can be provided inline after the `ansible-navigator` parameters or delimited by a `--`

```bash
$ ansible-navigator run site.yml --forks 15
$ ansible-navigator run site.yml -- --forks 15
```

### How can I use a vault password with `ansible-navigator`?

The following options provide a vault password to `ansible-navigator` when using the text-based user interface (TUI). **Please ensure these do not conflict with your enterprise security standards. Do not add password files to source control.**

1. Store the vault password securely on the local file system

```bash
$ touch ~/.vault_password
$ chmod 600 ~/.vault_password
# The leading space here is necessary to keep the command out of the command history
$  echo my_password >> ~/.vault_password
# Link the password file into the current working directory
$ ln ~/.vault_password .
# Set the environment variable to the location of the file
$ ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=.vault_password
$ ansible-navigator run site.yml
```

2. Store the vault password in an environment variable

```bash
$ touch ~/.vault_password.sh
$ chmod 700 ~/.vault_password.sh
$ echo -e '#!/bin/sh\necho ${ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD}' >> ~/.vault_password.sh
# Link the password file into the current working directory
$ ln ~/.vault_password.sh .
# The leading space here is necessary to keep the command out of the command history
# by using an environment variable prefixed with ANSIBLE it will automatically get passed
# into the execution environment
$  export ANSIBLE_VAULT_SECRET=my_password
# Set the environment variable to the location of the file
$ ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=.vault_password.sh
$ ansible-navigator run site.yml
```

Additional information about `ansible-vault` can be found [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html)

## Other

### How can complex commands be run inside an execution-environment?

The easiest way to pass complex commands to an execution environment is by using the `--` delimiter. Everything after the `--` will be passed into the execution-environment.

```bash
$ ansible-navigator exec -- ansible --version | head -n 1 | awk -F '\\[|\\]|\\s' '{print $4}'
2.12.4rc1.post0
```

### Why did I get an error about `/dev/mqueue` missing?

Although the `/dev/mqueue` directory is not used by `ansible-navigator`, it is currently required when using `podman`. Not all operating systems have a `/dev/mqueue` directory by default.

Please reference the documentation for your operating system related to POSIX message queues, or simply create the directory.

### Something didn't work, how can I troubleshoot it?

`ansible-navigator` has reasonable logging messages, debug logging can be enabled with `--log-level debug`. If you think you might have found a bug, please [log an issue](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-navigator/issues/new/choose) and include the details from the log file.
