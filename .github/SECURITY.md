# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Ansible Navigator does not backport security fixes only applying
them to the main branch and making the next patch release in the stream.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage responsible disclosure practices for security
vulnerabilities. Please read our [policies for reporting bugs]
[bug reports policy] if you want to report a security issue that might affect
Ansible.
