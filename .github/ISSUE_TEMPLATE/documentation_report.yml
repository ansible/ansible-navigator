      I was reading the ansible-navigator documentation and I'm having

        We would do it by ourselves but unfortunatelly, the curent
        edition of GitHub Issue Forms Alpha does not support this yet 🤷


        _We will make it easier in the future, once GitHub
        supports dropdown defaults. Promise!_

    # FIXME: Once GitHub allows defining the default choice, update this

      **Tip:** Be advised that the source for some parts of the
      documentation are hosted outside of this repository. If the page
      you are reporting describes modules/plugins/etc that are not
      officially supported by the Ansible Core Engineering team, there
      is a good chance that it is coming from one of the [Ansible
      Collections maintained by the community][collections org]. If this
      is the case, please make sure to file an issue under the
      appropriate project there instead.
