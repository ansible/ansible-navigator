      Describe the new feature/improvement you would like briefly below.


      What's the problem this feature will solve?

      What are you trying to do, that you are unable to achieve
      with ansible-navigator as it currently stands?


      * Provide examples of real-world use cases that this would enable
      and how it solves the problem you described.

      * How do you solve this now?

      * Have you tried to work around the problem using other tools?

      * Could there be a different approach to solving this issue?

    placeholder: >-
      I am trying to do X with ansible-navigator from the main branch on GitHub and
      I think that implementing a feature Y would be very helpful for me and
      every other user of ansible-navigator because of Z.

        We would do it by ourselves but unfortunatelly, the curent
        edition of GitHub Issue Forms Alpha does not support this yet ü§∑


        _We will make it easier in the future, once GitHub
        supports dropdown defaults. Promise!_
