    - 'Starting with Ansible 2.5 we recommend using C(connection: network_cli).'
    - 'Starting with Ansible 2.6 we recommend using C(connection: httpapi) for NX-API.'
    - This option will be removed in a release after 2022-06-01.
    - For more information please see the L(NXOS Platform Options guide, ../network/user_guide/platform_nxos.html).
    - HORIZONTALLINE
    - A dict object containing connection details.
    type: dict
    suboptions:
      host:
        description:
        - Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device
          over the specified transport.  The value of host is used as the destination
          address for the transport.
        type: str
      port:
        description:
        - Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.  This
          value applies to either I(cli) or I(nxapi).  The port value will default
          to the appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task.  (cli=22,
          http=80, https=443).
        type: int
      username:
        description:
        - Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote
          device.  This value is used to authenticate either the CLI login or the
          nxapi authentication depending on which transport is used. If the value
          is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable C(ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME)
          will be used instead.
        type: str
      password:
        description:
        - Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote
          device.  This is a common argument used for either I(cli) or I(nxapi) transports.
          If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable
          C(ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD) will be used instead.
        type: str
      authorize:
        description:
        - Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before
          sending any commands.  If not specified, the device will attempt to execute
          all commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the
          task, the value of environment variable C(ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE) will be
          used instead.
        type: bool
        default: false
      auth_pass:
        description:
        - Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the
          remote device.  If I(authorize) is false, then this argument does nothing.
          If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable
          C(ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS) will be used instead.
        type: str
      timeout:
        description:
        - Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device
          for either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before
          the operation is completed, the module will error. NX-API can be slow to
          return on long-running commands (sh mac, sh bgp, etc).
        type: int
      ssh_keyfile:
        description:
        - Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote
          device.  This argument is only used for the I(cli) transport. If the value
          is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable C(ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE)
          will be used instead.
        type: str
      transport:
        description:
        - Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote
          device.  The transport argument supports connectivity to the device over
          cli (ssh) or nxapi.
        type: str
        choices:
        - cli
        - nxapi
        default: cli
      use_ssl:
        description:
        - Configures the I(transport) to use SSL if set to C(yes) only when the C(transport=nxapi),
          otherwise this value is ignored.
        type: bool
        default: false
      validate_certs:
        description:
        - If C(no), SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only be used
          on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.  If the transport
          argument is not nxapi, this value is ignored.
        type: bool
        default: False
      use_proxy:
        description:
        - If C(no), the environment variables C(http_proxy) and C(https_proxy) will
          be ignored.
        type: bool
        default: true
