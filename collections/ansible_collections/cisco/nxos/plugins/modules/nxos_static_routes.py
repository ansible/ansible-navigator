module: nxos_static_routes
short_description: Static routes resource module
description: This module configures and manages the attributes of static routes on
  Cisco NX-OS platforms.
version_added: 1.0.0
author: Adharsh Srivats Rangarajan (@adharshsrivatsr)
notes:
- Tested against NX-OS 7.3.(0)D1(1) on VIRL
- When a route is configured for a non-existent VRF, the VRF is created and the route
  is added to it.
- When deleting routes for a VRF, all routes inside the VRF are deleted, but the VRF
  is not deleted.
options:
  running_config:
    description:
    - This option is used only with state I(parsed).
    - The value of this option should be the output received from the NX-OS device
      by executing the following commands in order B(show running-config | include
      '^ip(v6)* route') and B(show running-config | section '^vrf context').
    - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and
      transforms it into Ansible structured data as per the resource module's argspec
      and the value is then returned in the I(parsed) key within the result.
