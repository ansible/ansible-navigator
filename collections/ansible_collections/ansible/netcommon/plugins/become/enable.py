short_description: Switch to elevated permissions on a network device
description:
- This become plugins allows elevated permissions on a remote network device.
version_added: 1.0.0
options:
  become_pass:

    - section: enable_become_plugin
      key: password
    vars:
    - name: ansible_become_password
    - name: ansible_become_pass
    - name: ansible_enable_pass
    env:
    - name: ANSIBLE_BECOME_PASS
    - name: ANSIBLE_ENABLE_PASS
notes:
- enable is really implemented in the network connection handler and as such can only
  be used with network connections.
- This plugin ignores the 'become_exe' and 'become_user' settings as it uses an API
  and not an executable.
