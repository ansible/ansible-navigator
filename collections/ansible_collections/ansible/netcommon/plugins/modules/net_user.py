module: net_user
author: Trishna Guha (@trishnaguha)
short_description: (deprecated, removed after 2022-06-01) Manage the aggregate of
  local users on network device
description:
- This module provides declarative management of the local usernames configured on
  network devices. It allows playbooks to manage either individual usernames or the
  aggregate of usernames in the current running config. It also supports purging usernames
  from the configuration that are not explicitly defined.
version_added: 1.0.0
deprecated:
  alternative: Use platform-specific "[netos]_user" module
  why: Updated modules released with more functionality
  removed_at_date: '2022-06-01'
extends_documentation_fragment:
- ansible.netcommon.network_agnostic
options:
  aggregate:
    description:
    - The set of username objects to be configured on the remote network device. The
      list entries can either be the username or a hash of username and properties.
      This argument is mutually exclusive with the C(name) argument.
  name:
    description:
    - The username to be configured on the remote network device. This argument accepts
      a string value and is mutually exclusive with the C(aggregate) argument. Please
      note that this option is not same as C(provider username).
  configured_password:
    description:
    - The password to be configured on the remote network device. The password needs
      to be provided in clear and it will be encrypted on the device. Please note
      that this option is not same as C(provider password).
  update_password:
    description:
    - Since passwords are encrypted in the device running config, this argument will
      instruct the module when to change the password.  When set to C(always), the
      password will always be updated in the device and when set to C(on_create) the
      password will be updated only if the username is created.
    default: always
    choices:
    - on_create
    - always
  privilege:
    description:
    - The C(privilege) argument configures the privilege level of the user when logged
      into the system. This argument accepts integer values in the range of 1 to 15.
  role:
    description:
    - Configures the role for the username in the device running configuration. The
      argument accepts a string value defining the role name. This argument does not
      check if the role has been configured on the device.
  sshkey:
    description:
    - Specifies the SSH public key to configure for the given username. This argument
      accepts a valid SSH key value.
  nopassword:
    description:
    - Defines the username without assigning a password. This will allow the user
      to login to the system without being authenticated by a password.
    type: bool
  purge:
    description:
    - Instructs the module to consider the resource definition absolute. It will remove
      any previously configured usernames on the device with the exception of the
      `admin` user (the current defined set of users).
    type: bool
    default: false
  state:
    description:
    - Configures the state of the username definition as it relates to the device
      operational configuration. When set to I(present), the username(s) should be
      configured in the device active configuration and when set to I(absent) the
      username(s) should not be in the device active configuration
    default: present
    choices:
    - present
    - absent
