        description: The shadow-utils package includes the necessary programs for  converting
          UNIX password files to the shadow password format, plus  programs for managing
          user and group accounts. The pwconv command  converts passwords to the shadow
          password format. The pwunconv command  unconverts shadow passwords and generates
          a passwd file (a standard  UNIX password file). The pwck command checks
          the integrity of password  and shadow files. The lastlog command prints
          out the last login times  for all users. The useradd, userdel, and usermod
          commands are used for  managing user accounts. The groupadd, groupdel, and
          groupmod commands  are used for managing group accounts.

          of specified  processes. The tload command prints a graph of the current
          system  load average to a specified tty. The uptime command displays the  current
          time, how long the system has been running, how many users  are logged on,
          and system load averages for the past one, five,  and fifteen minutes. The
          w command displays a list of the users  who are currently logged on and
          what they are running. The watch  program watches a running program. The
          vmstat command displays  virtual memory statistics about processes, memory,

          your system to  handle Perl scripts with /usr/bin/perl interpreter.    If
          your script requires some Perl modules, you can install them with  "perl(MODULE)"
          where "MODULE" is a name of required module. E.g. install  "perl(Test::More)"
          to make Test::More Perl module available.    If you need all the Perl modules
          that come with upstream Perl sources, so  called core modules, install perl
          package.    If you only need perl run-time as a shared library, i.e. Perl
          interpreter  embedded into another application, the only essential package
          is perl-libs.    Perl header files can be found in perl-devel package.    Perl
          utils like "splain" or "perlbug" can be found in perl-utils package.

        description: PCRE2 is a re-working of the original PCRE (Perl-compatible regular  expression)
          library to provide an entirely new API.    PCRE2 is written in C, and it
          has its own API. There are three sets of  functions, one for the 8-bit library,
          which processes strings of bytes, one  for the 16-bit library, which processes
          strings of 16-bit values, and one for  the 32-bit library, which processes
          strings of 32-bit values. There are no C++  wrappers. This package provides
          support for strings in 8-bit and UTF-8  encodings. Install pcre2-utf16 or
          pcre2-utf32 packages for the other ones.    The distribution does contain
          a set of C wrapper functions for the 8-bit  library that are based on the
          POSIX regular expression API (see the pcre2posix  man page). These can be
          found in a library called libpcre2posix. Note that  this just provides a
          POSIX calling interface to PCRE2; the regular expressions  themselves still
          follow Perl syntax and semantics. The POSIX API is  restricted, and does
          not give full access to all of PCRE2's facilities.

          the traditional Unix ''crypt'' and ''crypt_r''  interfaces, as well as a
          set of extended interfaces pioneered by  Openwall Linux, ''crypt_rn'', ''crypt_ra'',
          ''crypt_gensalt'',  ''crypt_gensalt_rn'', and ''crypt_gensalt_ra''.    libxcrypt
          is intended to be used by login(1), passwd(1), and other  similar programs;
          that is, to hash a small number of passwords during  an interactive authentication
          dialogue with a human.  It is not  suitable for use in bulk password-cracking
          applications, or in any  other situation where speed is more important than
          careful handling of  sensitive data.  However, it *is* intended to be fast
          and lightweight  enough for use in servers that must field thousands of
          login attempts  per minute.    On Linux-based systems, by default libxcrypt
          will be binary backward  compatible with the libcrypt.so.1 shipped as part
          of the GNU C Library.  This means that all existing binary executables linked
          against glibc''s  libcrypt should work unmodified with this library''s libcrypt.so.1.  We  have
          taken pains to provide exactly the same "symbol versions" as were  used
          by glibc on various CPU architectures, and to account for the  variety of
          ways in which the Openwall extensions were patched into  glibc''s libcrypt
          by some Linux distributions.  (For instance,  compatibility symlinks for
          SuSE''s "libowcrypt" are provided.)    However, the converse is not true:
          programs linked against libxcrypt  will not work with glibc''s libcrypt.  Also,

        description: Compilers for high level languages generate code that follow
          certain  conventions.  These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate  compilation
          to work.  One such convention is the "calling convention".  The calling
          convention is a set of assumptions made by the compiler  about where function
          arguments will be found on entry to a function.  A  calling convention also
          specifies where the return value for a function  is found.    Some programs
          may not know at the time of compilation what arguments  are to be passed
          to a function.  For instance, an interpreter may be  told at run-time about
          the number and types of arguments used to call a  given function.  `Libffi'
          can be used in such programs to provide a  bridge from the interpreter program
          to compiled code.    The `libffi' library provides a portable, high level
          programming  interface to various calling conventions.  This allows a programmer
          to  call any function specified by a call interface description at run time.    FFI
          stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function  interface is
          the popular name for the interface that allows code  written in one language
          to call code written in another language.  The  `libffi' library really
          only provides the lowest, machine dependent  layer of a fully featured foreign
          function interface.  A layer must  exist above `libffi' that handles type
          conversions for values passed  between the two languages.

        description: 'CrackLib tests passwords to determine whether they match certain  security-oriented
          characteristics, with the purpose of stopping users  from choosing passwords
          that are easy to guess. CrackLib performs  several tests on passwords: it
          tries to generate words from a username  and gecos entry and checks those
          words against the password; it checks  for simplistic patterns in passwords;
          and it checks for the password  in a dictionary.    CrackLib is actually
          a library containing a particular C function  which is used to check the
          password, as well as other C  functions. CrackLib is not a replacement for
          a passwd program; it must  be used in conjunction with an existing passwd
          program.    Install the cracklib package if you need a program to check
          users''  passwords to see if they are at least minimally secure. If you
          install  CrackLib, you will also want to install the cracklib-dicts package.'

          files which contain a collection of other files plus information  about
          them, such as their file name, owner, timestamps, and access  permissions.  The
          archive can be another file on the disk, a magnetic  tape, or a pipe.  GNU
          cpio supports the following archive formats:  binary,  old ASCII, new ASCII,
          crc, HPUX binary, HPUX old ASCII, old tar and POSIX.1  tar.  By default,
          cpio creates binary format archives, so that they are  compatible with older
          cpio programs.  When it is extracting files from  archives, cpio automatically
          recognizes which kind of archive it is reading  and can read archives created

        description: The nested_quotewords() and quotewords() functions accept a delimiter
          (which  can be a regular expression) and a list of lines and then breaks
          those lines  up into a list of words ignoring delimiters that appear inside
          quotes.  quotewords() returns all of the tokens in a single long list, while  nested_quotewords()
          returns a list of token lists corresponding to the  elements of @lines.
          parse_line() does tokenizing on a single string. The  quotewords() functions
          simply call &parse_line(), so if you're only splitting  one line you can
          call parse_line() directly and save a function call.

          which processes strings of bytes, one  for the 16-bit library, which processes
          strings of 16-bit values, and one for  the 32-bit library, which processes
          strings of 32-bit values. There are no C++  wrappers. This package provides
          support for strings in 8-bit and UTF-8  encodings. Install pcre2-utf16 or
          pcre2-utf32 packages for the other ones.    The distribution does contain
          a set of C wrapper functions for the 8-bit  library that are based on the
          POSIX regular expression API (see the pcre2posix  man page). These can be
          found in a library called libpcre2posix. Note that  this just provides a
          POSIX calling interface to PCRE2; the regular expressions  themselves still
          follow Perl syntax and semantics. The POSIX API is  restricted, and does
          not give full access to all of PCRE2's facilities.

          the traditional Unix ''crypt'' and ''crypt_r''  interfaces, as well as a
          set of extended interfaces pioneered by  Openwall Linux, ''crypt_rn'', ''crypt_ra'',
          ''crypt_gensalt'',  ''crypt_gensalt_rn'', and ''crypt_gensalt_ra''.    libxcrypt
          is intended to be used by login(1), passwd(1), and other  similar programs;
          that is, to hash a small number of passwords during  an interactive authentication
          dialogue with a human.  It is not  suitable for use in bulk password-cracking
          applications, or in any  other situation where speed is more important than
          careful handling of  sensitive data.  However, it *is* intended to be fast
          and lightweight  enough for use in servers that must field thousands of
          login attempts  per minute.    On Linux-based systems, by default libxcrypt
          will be binary backward  compatible with the libcrypt.so.1 shipped as part
          of the GNU C Library.  This means that all existing binary executables linked
          against glibc''s  libcrypt should work unmodified with this library''s libcrypt.so.1.  We  have
          taken pains to provide exactly the same "symbol versions" as were  used
          by glibc on various CPU architectures, and to account for the  variety of
          ways in which the Openwall extensions were patched into  glibc''s libcrypt
          by some Linux distributions.  (For instance,  compatibility symlinks for
          SuSE''s "libowcrypt" are provided.)    However, the converse is not true:
          programs linked against libxcrypt  will not work with glibc''s libcrypt.  Also,
          programs that use certain  legacy APIs supplied by glibc''s libcrypt (''encrypt'',
          ''encrypt_r'',  ''setkey'', ''setkey_r'', and ''fcrypt'') cannot be compiled

          (TI-RPC) documentation.  This library forms a piece of the base of  Open
          Network Computing (ONC), and is derived directly from the  Solaris 2.3 source.    TI-RPC
          is an enhanced version of TS-RPC that requires the UNIX System V  Transport
          Layer Interface (TLI) or an equivalent X/Open Transport Interface  (XTI).  TI-RPC
          is on-the-wire compatible with the TS-RPC, which is supported  by almost
          70 vendors on all major operating systems.  TS-RPC source code  (RPCSRC
          4.0) remains available from several internet sites.

        description: Compilers for high level languages generate code that follow
          certain  conventions.  These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate  compilation
          to work.  One such convention is the "calling convention".  The calling
          convention is a set of assumptions made by the compiler  about where function
          arguments will be found on entry to a function.  A  calling convention also
          specifies where the return value for a function  is found.    Some programs
          may not know at the time of compilation what arguments  are to be passed
          to a function.  For instance, an interpreter may be  told at run-time about
          the number and types of arguments used to call a  given function.  `Libffi'
          can be used in such programs to provide a  bridge from the interpreter program
          to compiled code.    The `libffi' library provides a portable, high level
          programming  interface to various calling conventions.  This allows a programmer
          to  call any function specified by a call interface description at run time.    FFI
          stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function  interface is
          the popular name for the interface that allows code  written in one language
          to call code written in another language.  The  `libffi' library really
          only provides the lowest, machine dependent  layer of a fully featured foreign
          function interface.  A layer must  exist above `libffi' that handles type
          conversions for values passed  between the two languages.

        description: This is expat, the C library for parsing XML, written by James
          Clark. Expat  is a stream oriented XML parser. This means that you register
          handlers with  the parser prior to starting the parse. These handlers are
          called when the  parser discovers the associated structures in the document
          being parsed. A  start tag is an example of the kind of structures for which
          you may  register handlers.

          reference  interpreter for the Python language, version 3.  The majority
          of its standard library is provided in the python38-libs package,  which
          should be installed automatically along with python38.  The remaining parts
          of the Python standard library are broken out into the  python38-tkinter
          and python38-test packages, which may need to be installed  separately.    Documentation
          for Python is provided in the python38-docs package.    Packages containing
          additional libraries for Python are generally named with  the "python38-"
          prefix.    For the unversioned "python" executable, see manual page "unversioned-python".'

          those lines  up into a list of words ignoring delimiters that appear inside
          quotes.  quotewords() returns all of the tokens in a single long list, while  nested_quotewords()
          returns a list of token lists corresponding to the  elements of @lines.
          parse_line() does tokenizing on a single string. The  quotewords() functions
          simply call &parse_line(), so if you're only splitting  one line you can
          call parse_line() directly and save a function call.

          which processes strings of bytes, one  for the 16-bit library, which processes
          strings of 16-bit values, and one for  the 32-bit library, which processes
          strings of 32-bit values. There are no C++  wrappers. This package provides
          support for strings in 8-bit and UTF-8  encodings. Install pcre2-utf16 or
          pcre2-utf32 packages for the other ones.    The distribution does contain
          a set of C wrapper functions for the 8-bit  library that are based on the
          POSIX regular expression API (see the pcre2posix  man page). These can be
          found in a library called libpcre2posix. Note that  this just provides a
          POSIX calling interface to PCRE2; the regular expressions  themselves still
          follow Perl syntax and semantics. The POSIX API is  restricted, and does
          not give full access to all of PCRE2's facilities.

          the traditional Unix ''crypt'' and ''crypt_r''  interfaces, as well as a
          set of extended interfaces pioneered by  Openwall Linux, ''crypt_rn'', ''crypt_ra'',
          ''crypt_gensalt'',  ''crypt_gensalt_rn'', and ''crypt_gensalt_ra''.    libxcrypt
          is intended to be used by login(1), passwd(1), and other  similar programs;
          that is, to hash a small number of passwords during  an interactive authentication
          dialogue with a human.  It is not  suitable for use in bulk password-cracking
          applications, or in any  other situation where speed is more important than
          careful handling of  sensitive data.  However, it *is* intended to be fast
          and lightweight  enough for use in servers that must field thousands of
          login attempts  per minute.    On Linux-based systems, by default libxcrypt
          will be binary backward  compatible with the libcrypt.so.1 shipped as part
          of the GNU C Library.  This means that all existing binary executables linked
          against glibc''s  libcrypt should work unmodified with this library''s libcrypt.so.1.  We  have
          taken pains to provide exactly the same "symbol versions" as were  used
          by glibc on various CPU architectures, and to account for the  variety of
          ways in which the Openwall extensions were patched into  glibc''s libcrypt
          by some Linux distributions.  (For instance,  compatibility symlinks for
          SuSE''s "libowcrypt" are provided.)    However, the converse is not true:
          programs linked against libxcrypt  will not work with glibc''s libcrypt.  Also,
          programs that use certain  legacy APIs supplied by glibc''s libcrypt (''encrypt'',
          ''encrypt_r'',  ''setkey'', ''setkey_r'', and ''fcrypt'') cannot be compiled

          is an enhanced version of TS-RPC that requires the UNIX System V  Transport
          Layer Interface (TLI) or an equivalent X/Open Transport Interface  (XTI).  TI-RPC
          is on-the-wire compatible with the TS-RPC, which is supported  by almost
          70 vendors on all major operating systems.  TS-RPC source code  (RPCSRC
          4.0) remains available from several internet sites.

        description: Compilers for high level languages generate code that follow
          certain  conventions.  These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate  compilation
          to work.  One such convention is the "calling convention".  The calling
          convention is a set of assumptions made by the compiler  about where function
          arguments will be found on entry to a function.  A  calling convention also
          specifies where the return value for a function  is found.    Some programs
          may not know at the time of compilation what arguments  are to be passed
          to a function.  For instance, an interpreter may be  told at run-time about
          the number and types of arguments used to call a  given function.  `Libffi'
          can be used in such programs to provide a  bridge from the interpreter program
          to compiled code.    The `libffi' library provides a portable, high level
          programming  interface to various calling conventions.  This allows a programmer
          to  call any function specified by a call interface description at run time.    FFI
          stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function  interface is
          the popular name for the interface that allows code  written in one language
          to call code written in another language.  The  `libffi' library really
          only provides the lowest, machine dependent  layer of a fully featured foreign
          function interface.  A layer must  exist above `libffi' that handles type
          conversions for values passed  between the two languages.

          the amounts of free and used memory on your  system. The skill command sends
          a terminate command (or another  specified signal) to a specified set of
          processes. The snice  command is used to change the scheduling priority
          of specified  processes. The tload command prints a graph of the current
          system  load average to a specified tty. The uptime command displays the  current
          time, how long the system has been running, how many users  are logged on,
          and system load averages for the past one, five,  and fifteen minutes. The
          w command displays a list of the users  who are currently logged on and
          what they are running. The watch  program watches a running program. The
          vmstat command displays  virtual memory statistics about processes, memory,

          strings of 16-bit values, and one for  the 32-bit library, which processes
          strings of 32-bit values. There are no C++  wrappers. This package provides

          pcre2-utf32 packages for the other ones.    The distribution does contain
          a set of C wrapper functions for the 8-bit  library that are based on the
          POSIX regular expression API (see the pcre2posix  man page). These can be
          found in a library called libpcre2posix. Note that  this just provides a
          POSIX calling interface to PCRE2; the regular expressions  themselves still
          follow Perl syntax and semantics. The POSIX API is  restricted, and does

          the traditional Unix ''crypt'' and ''crypt_r''  interfaces, as well as a
          set of extended interfaces pioneered by  Openwall Linux, ''crypt_rn'', ''crypt_ra'',
          ''crypt_gensalt'',  ''crypt_gensalt_rn'', and ''crypt_gensalt_ra''.    libxcrypt
          is intended to be used by login(1), passwd(1), and other  similar programs;
          that is, to hash a small number of passwords during  an interactive authentication
          dialogue with a human.  It is not  suitable for use in bulk password-cracking
          applications, or in any  other situation where speed is more important than
          careful handling of  sensitive data.  However, it *is* intended to be fast
          and lightweight  enough for use in servers that must field thousands of
          login attempts  per minute.    On Linux-based systems, by default libxcrypt
          will be binary backward  compatible with the libcrypt.so.1 shipped as part
          of the GNU C Library.  This means that all existing binary executables linked
          against glibc''s  libcrypt should work unmodified with this library''s libcrypt.so.1.  We  have
          taken pains to provide exactly the same "symbol versions" as were  used
          by glibc on various CPU architectures, and to account for the  variety of
          ways in which the Openwall extensions were patched into  glibc''s libcrypt
          by some Linux distributions.  (For instance,  compatibility symlinks for
          SuSE''s "libowcrypt" are provided.)    However, the converse is not true:
          programs linked against libxcrypt  will not work with glibc''s libcrypt.  Also,
          programs that use certain  legacy APIs supplied by glibc''s libcrypt (''encrypt'',
          ''encrypt_r'',  ''setkey'', ''setkey_r'', and ''fcrypt'') cannot be compiled

        description: Compilers for high level languages generate code that follow
          certain  conventions.  These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate  compilation
          to work.  One such convention is the "calling convention".  The calling
          convention is a set of assumptions made by the compiler  about where function
          arguments will be found on entry to a function.  A  calling convention also
          specifies where the return value for a function  is found.    Some programs
          may not know at the time of compilation what arguments  are to be passed
          to a function.  For instance, an interpreter may be  told at run-time about
          the number and types of arguments used to call a  given function.  `Libffi'
          can be used in such programs to provide a  bridge from the interpreter program
          to compiled code.    The `libffi' library provides a portable, high level
          programming  interface to various calling conventions.  This allows a programmer
          to  call any function specified by a call interface description at run time.    FFI
          stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function  interface is
          the popular name for the interface that allows code  written in one language
          to call code written in another language.  The  `libffi' library really
          only provides the lowest, machine dependent  layer of a fully featured foreign
          function interface.  A layer must  exist above `libffi' that handles type
          conversions for values passed  between the two languages.

        description: The gmp package contains GNU MP, a library for arbitrary precision  arithmetic,
          signed integers operations, rational numbers and floating  point numbers.
          GNU MP is designed for speed, for both small and very  large operands. GNU
          MP is fast because it uses fullwords as the basic  arithmetic type, it uses
          fast algorithms, it carefully optimizes  assembly code for many CPUs' most
          common inner loops, and it generally  emphasizes speed over simplicity/elegance
          in its operations.    Install the gmp package if you need a fast arbitrary
          precision  library.

        description: systemd is a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and
          starts  the rest of the system. It provides aggressive parallelization  capabilities,
          uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services,  offers on-demand
          starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using  Linux control groups,
          maintains mount and automount points, and  implements an elaborate transactional
          dependency-based service control  logic. systemd supports SysV and LSB init
          scripts and works as a  replacement for sysvinit. Other parts of this package
          are a logging daemon,  utilities to control basic system configuration like
          the hostname,  date, locale, maintain a list of logged-in users, system
          accounts,  runtime directories and settings, and daemons to manage simple
          network  configuration, network time synchronization, log forwarding, and
          name  resolution.

        description: Pexpect is a pure Python module for spawning child applications;
          controlling  them; and responding to expected patterns in their output.
          Pexpect works like  Don Libes' Expect. Pexpect allows your script to spawn
          a child application and  control it as if a human were typing commands.
          This package contains the  python3 version of this module.    Pexpect can
          be used for automating interactive applications such as ssh, ftp,  passwd,
          telnet, etc. It can be used to automate setup scripts for duplicating  software
          package installations on different servers. And it can be used for  automated
          software testing. Pexpect is in the spirit of Don Libes' Expect, but  Pexpect
          is pure Python. Unlike other Expect-like modules for Python, Pexpect  does
          not require TCL or Expect nor does it require C extensions to be  compiled.  It
          should work on any platform that supports the standard Python  pty module.

          found in a library called libpcre2posix. Note that  this just provides a

          follow Perl syntax and semantics. The POSIX API is  restricted, and does
          not give full access to all of PCRE2's facilities.

          ''crypt_gensalt'',  ''crypt_gensalt_rn'', and ''crypt_gensalt_ra''.    libxcrypt
          is intended to be used by login(1), passwd(1), and other  similar programs;
          that is, to hash a small number of passwords during  an interactive authentication
          dialogue with a human.  It is not  suitable for use in bulk password-cracking
          applications, or in any  other situation where speed is more important than
          careful handling of  sensitive data.  However, it *is* intended to be fast
          and lightweight  enough for use in servers that must field thousands of
          login attempts  per minute.    On Linux-based systems, by default libxcrypt
          will be binary backward  compatible with the libcrypt.so.1 shipped as part
          of the GNU C Library.  This means that all existing binary executables linked
          against glibc''s  libcrypt should work unmodified with this library''s libcrypt.so.1.  We  have

          by glibc on various CPU architectures, and to account for the  variety of
          ways in which the Openwall extensions were patched into  glibc''s libcrypt
          by some Linux distributions.  (For instance,  compatibility symlinks for
          SuSE''s "libowcrypt" are provided.)    However, the converse is not true:
          programs linked against libxcrypt  will not work with glibc''s libcrypt.  Also,
          programs that use certain  legacy APIs supplied by glibc''s libcrypt (''encrypt'',
          ''encrypt_r'',  ''setkey'', ''setkey_r'', and ''fcrypt'') cannot be compiled

          drop in for the libusb-1.0.9 release. The libusbx fork was  started by most

          produce a new release for over 18 months.    Note that this library is not

          compatibility install the libusb package.

        description: Compilers for high level languages generate code that follow
          certain  conventions.  These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate  compilation
          to work.  One such convention is the "calling convention".  The calling
          convention is a set of assumptions made by the compiler  about where function
          arguments will be found on entry to a function.  A  calling convention also
          specifies where the return value for a function  is found.    Some programs
          may not know at the time of compilation what arguments  are to be passed
          to a function.  For instance, an interpreter may be  told at run-time about
          the number and types of arguments used to call a  given function.  `Libffi'
          can be used in such programs to provide a  bridge from the interpreter program
          to compiled code.    The `libffi' library provides a portable, high level
          programming  interface to various calling conventions.  This allows a programmer
          to  call any function specified by a call interface description at run time.    FFI
          stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function  interface is
          the popular name for the interface that allows code  written in one language
          to call code written in another language.  The  `libffi' library really
          only provides the lowest, machine dependent  layer of a fully featured foreign
          function interface.  A layer must  exist above `libffi' that handles type
          conversions for values passed  between the two languages.
